# SlideSpeaker Web

This directory contains the standalone Next.js + React frontend for SlideSpeaker. Move it to its own git repository (`slide-speaker-web`) to continue development alongside the API service.

## Quick Start

```bash
pnpm install          # Install dependencies (pnpm preferred)
cp .env.example .env  # Provide API base URL and NextAuth secrets
pnpm dev              # Run the app on http://localhost:3000
```

## Progressive Web App

- The app now exposes a Web App Manifest (`/manifest.webmanifest`) plus a service worker generated by `next-pwa`, so browsers can install SlideSpeaker AI as a standalone experience.
- To verify install prompts locally run `pnpm build && pnpm start`, then open the served HTTPS origin in Chrome/Edge and use the _Install App_ option.
- Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to the deployed origin so the manifest + metadata emit the correct absolute URLs in production.

### Environment Variables

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` – URL of the SlideSpeaker API (defaults to `http://localhost:8000`)
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` – Public URL for the web app
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` – Session signing secret
- Optional provider keys (Google, etc.) as required by NextAuth

## Testing & Tooling

- `pnpm lint` – ESLint
- `pnpm test` – Jest + React Testing Library
- `pnpm build` – Production build

## Code Quality

This project uses a pre-commit hook that automatically runs ESLint, TypeScript type checking, and Prettier on staged files before each commit.

## Relationship to API

The FastAPI backend remains in the root project (`api/`). Update `.env` values in this web app to point at the deployed API once the repositories are separated.
